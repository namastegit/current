No car can gulp those bags in the boot after 3 rows up , none ! Everyone knows they require a roof carrier for that ! At least here u can use roof carriers because of usable roof rails , 90 % of cars out there dont have usable roof rails , carens , alacazar etc , and many other have panoramic sunroof like Safari , Xuv 500 etc , which again cant accommodate roof carrier ! Here at least we can use roof carrier!)"
