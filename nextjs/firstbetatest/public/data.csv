I am proud top end diesel automatic 4x4  for more than yeyar now done 45000 kms.I feel it is very fantastic product for value no major issues except unpredictable Android auto ( this is not Mahindra s fault ) Diesel engine is very Punchy and smooth feels like driving petrol engine.Gear shifting also smooth and have sport car like handling.There are some vertical movement but every body on frame SUV has it but it is more stable than a fortuner similar to endeavour.If anyone wants real SUV with 4x4 and body on the frame go for it.,(0)

Camera wala 360 karna chaye! Bhai Hindi me banao,"(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Hi, Haa Hindi me bhi banaunga videos. Subscribe karna aur video/channel ko share bhi :))"
"I agree that the front camera should engage when parking, additionally I feel that the front camera should also engage once we put the first gear into action and start to drive.",(Comment Reply -@shreyaskunder3788: The rear blower actually has a separate cooling coil and is made to throw cooled air for the third row hence the extra power since the third row doesn&#39;t have any ac vents.)
Does petrol drive feel confident at 120 speeds ? We are looking for highway and hills combo. But performance is also required. Could you share some light ?,"(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Hi, petrol and diesel is both are really good at high speeds and the handling is very good. Performance is not an issue because the petrol is a 200hp which is good. <br>Do subscribe to the channel:))"
Urs a diesel or a petrol,"(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Hi, mine is the diesel variant. Do subscribe to the channel:))"
I live in Melbourne and thinking of getting one of these. Thanks for the  insight much appreciated. Car looks really good probably the best looking suv in the market period. If they can quickly iron out the problems you have mentioned I&#39;d at my closest dealer in no time.,"(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Hi, it is really nice to own one. But it doesn’t come with its glitches. Most of them for me are tolerable except the cruise control on/off glitch - very irritating! <br>Overall, I’m enjoying the car :)<br>Do subscribe to the channel and share the video with friends and family:))"
"Forgot to add excellent video, loved it. Looking forward to more  of it, please keep it rolling.",(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Thanks :) What do you want to know in particular?)
They should have given sliding armrest in the front,(Comment Reply -@BunchofTech: Yes agreed! And also more storage in the front armrest. Because of the blower coil the arm rest storage is also less.)

Looks like some mahindra executive boasting its car. By no means m saying its a bad car. But all positive and talking abt mahindra history when nobody aksed him abt it. There is no drawback that he has mentioned And asking a guy who has not even driven 1000 km on it.,(0)
1 month is too soon to get a realistic experience review.  Everyone loves their car when it’s brand new.  😅,(Comment Reply -@arko966: Exactly... It&#39;s only VW cars that people still love when they are old.)

MLD should definitely be offered. Missing out on Scorpio N and giving it on the Bolero Neo makes no sense. Same with the hydraulic struts for the hood. They give it on the Scorpio Classic but not on the Scorpio N. And for Gods sake launch one with the jump seats. As such the last row is a joke for passengers and luggage.,(0)

"You can move 2nd seat forward , why didint you tell this","(Comment Reply -@joydeep23129: Exactly I&#39;m also thinking about the same thing, the 2nd row seats in Safari are slidable whereas it is fixed in Scorpio N, but I don&#39;t why he didn&#39;t mention that while comparing. Also, every other automobile journalist or car reviewer claims that Safari offers the most kneeroom in its segment while Scorpio N is generally known for having the least but here he said the exact opposite of that. Don&#39;t know what was actually going on there.)"

If Mahindra improves after sales nothing can beat their SUVs.I have Scorpio N petrol amd the drive is so smooth.Safari after borrowing parts from everywhere is like a gift packed well whereas Scorpio N is a real car with no gimmicks but only business.,(Comment Reply -@pgohil100: Well summed up.

"There is no comparison between 2. One is ( SN) &quot;Real&quot; SUV with body of frame, Rear wheel drives, 4X4, &amp; Rugged..Other one ( Safari) is front wheel drive ( like Car) with high ground clearance. Yes, Safari has good power and Torque similar like SN. But there is not comparison. If you want to compare, Compare with XUV700 vs Safari.Tata should use Old Safari characteristics- (body of frame, Rear wheel drives, 4X4, &amp; Rugged..) in new Safari to compare against SN.",(Comment Reply -@vedantbhardwaj6969: Kosish kiya tha tata ne pehele but logo ne khareeda nhi <br>Jab gadi thi tab purchase nhi karta tha<br>ab jab gadi nhi hai toh sabko randi rona karna hai 😒<br>Mere words harsh honge but truth hai lekin)
Hat&#39;s off to Mahindra they paid so well to youtuber.TATA should must learn this thing...Comparing two different cars itself is a joke😂😂😂,"(Comment Reply -@pgohil100: Scorpio and Safari are being compared since 20 years. Both were original Body On Frame and while Scorpio retained that characteristic, Safari couldn’t retain its original DNA. If Mahindra would have paid me, I wouldn’t have mentioned so many times that Safari looks better, has better comfort and has more features + tech 😊)"
Bro concluded Less features = More reliable,(Comment Reply -@pgohil100: After seeing numerous complaints about Tata’s reliability from customers online)

There is no comparison between these 2 machines..Scorpio N is real SUV and far ahead when it comes to capability and driving performance+pleasure.On other hand Safari is crossover and for people who want more features and car in cabin comfort...Scorpio N does not have any competition in its category..Thats why it got 1.5 lakh bookings and still People are in que😂😂😂😂...,(0)

Even you spend 19 lacs you don&#39;t get alloy wheels and ACC? What kind of strategy is this?,"(Comment Reply -@manishpandey5573: After spending 60 lacs u dont even get a sunroof in Fortuner! Here at least u can pay 50k more for the Original alloys , just consider the price as 19.5 instead of 19 , but in fortuner u cant get a sunroof no matter what u pay !)"
Why Mahindra these days making their petrol engines more powerful than the diesel one i mean the petrol has 200bhp with 370nm torque where as diesel has 175bhp with 370nm/400nm torque,(Comment Reply -@47.FortySeven.47: Cause Diesel is Crap with too Many Restrictions and a 10 Year Limit in Delhi NCR whereas Petrol Dosent have these issues)
My pick is z8 diesel manual 4WD anyday ❤️🔥,(Comment Reply -@jaikinger28: for that u gotta have that money)

I need a review of z6,(0)
But a petrol 4x4 variant is a need of the hour as the diesel one will not start in a winter expedition or in a sub zero temperature due to blue/urea getting frozen in those conditions....,(Comment Reply -@darkknighthacker07: Someone has made a video exactly opposite. Go check it outs. Its a red thar!)
booking z6 diesel manual on 30 jul,"(Comment Reply -@powerdriftofficial: Hey, congratulations Abhisek! :D)"

No boot space at all. Will you carry your Luggage on your head with 7 people onboard ?,"(Comment Reply -@manishpandey5573: Ha ha ha ha this is the D u m B£st notion 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 if u are travelling with 7 people and u are going for holidays or something, wont u think u must have at least 4-5 big bags , even if you are going for 2-3 days ! No car can gulp those bags in the boot after 3 rows up , none ! Everyone knows they require a roof carrier for that ! At least here u can use roof carriers because of usable roof rails , 90 % of cars out there dont have usable roof rails , carens , alacazar etc , and many other have panoramic sunroof like Safari , Xuv 500 etc , which again cant accommodate roof carrier ! Here at least we can use roof carrier!)"

Well 2100 RPM at 100 kmph is high rev range for this engine despite being in legal speed limit.,(Comment Reply -@interceptingthetime: it didn&#39;t feel while driving it)
Which is the Best? Z8L MT 4WD or Z8 AT 4WDBoth cost the samePros of AT : Easy DrivabilityMore Torque18&quot; AlloysPros of Z8L MT : Thril of Manual Additional FeaturesBut 17&quot; alloys that look kinda smallNow you guys suggest 🤷🏻‍♂️,(Comment Reply -@imranansari84: Up h o)

"Hi, is it worth buying Z6  diesel manual. Considering the upcoming restriction on diesel vehicles, need clarity if buying z6 now will be a issue of restriction in future and also for resale vlaue in future","(Comment Reply -@asullya4934: Z6 is not worth because first of all Mahindra is not delivering it as of yet, and when you receive it the prices would have increased a lot. And 2nd, it just has Alexa and Sunroof on top of lower Z4 model. So, my humble opinion is Z4 is more VFM and save that money for fitting the alloys. And that&#39;s what I did. My Z4 D AT already reached the dealership.)"
